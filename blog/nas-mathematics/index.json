  { "key": "introduction", "value": "Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has revolutionized the field of deep learning by automating the design of neural network architectures. While early methods relied on **reinforcement learning** or **evolutionary algorithms**, recent advances in **differentiable architecture search** have made the process more efficient and mathematically principled.\n\nIn this article, we'll dive deep into the mathematical foundations that make differentiable NAS possible, exploring the bilevel optimization problem at its core and the elegant solutions that have emerged." },
  { "key": "mathFoundationText", "value": "At the heart of neural architecture search lies a **bilevel optimization problem**. Unlike standard neural network training, where we optimize only the network weights, NAS requires us to simultaneously optimize both the architecture parameters and the network weights.\n\nThis creates a hierarchical optimization structure where the lower-level problem (weight optimization) must be solved for each candidate architecture in the upper-level problem (architecture optimization)." },
  { "key": "gradientComputationText", "value": "The key insight in differentiable NAS is that we can compute gradients of the validation loss with respect to architecture parameters using the **chain rule**. However, this requires careful handling of the implicit function theorem since the optimal weights depend on the architecture parameters." },
  { "key": "implementationText", "value": "The DARTS (Differentiable Architecture Search) algorithm provides an elegant solution to the bilevel optimization problem by using a **continuous relaxation** of the architecture search space. Instead of searching over discrete architectural choices, DARTS parameterizes the search space using continuous variables." },
